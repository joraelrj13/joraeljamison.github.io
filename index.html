										<h2><a href="#">Benton County Jail<br />
										Docket Extract</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="files/tutorial.pdf" target="_blank" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Every night the court docket needs to be generated at the jail. This process
									can be very time consuming, taking an officer upward 1 to 2 hours in order to complete.
									I wrote this program as a proof of concept while obtaining my BAS degree, thinking there must 
									be a more efficient way to generate the docket. After much trial and error, and utilzing the help and input of
									fellow officers, I was able to sucessfully achieve a working program. The python script I wrote for 
									this program streamlines the process, it takes in the daily jail roster and compares it
									to the daily superior and district court dockets. It instantly compiles all the names of 
									'in custody' inmates who are on the court docket, than prints it in the preferred
									format, along with thier housing assignment.<br /> Overall, it has received very positive feedback.
									The court officers especially love the program as they utilize it daily to cross-reference the docket. If the docket
									was missed the night before, they are able to create the entire thing in less than 10 minutes.
									Additionally, as shown in testing, this program is significantly more accurate than manually completing the docket, 
									as it mitigates human error of excluding a name. I am working on upgrading this script by turning it into a 
									GUI Interface application. This will further simplify the process. This GUI app is currently in beta stages and has 
									not been rolled out to the jail.</p>

									<a href="files/capstone.pdf" target="_blank" class="image fit"><img src="images/cap.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>For my capstone project in cybersecurity, I conducted an 
									an assessment of smartphone security vulnerabilities. The scope of
									this project involved a research-based approach where I investigated
									various aspects of smartphone security, including data leaks, weak passwords,
									unsecure networks, and malicous applications. Additionally, this project covered 
									application permissions vulnerabilites, phishing methods, spam identification, 
									and safe browsing practices. I felt this was an important and relevant topic
									with the widespread usage of mobile devices that contain a multitude of personal 
									and sensitive data, making them lucrative targets to be exploited. </p>
